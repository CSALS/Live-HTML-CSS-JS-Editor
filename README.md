Add different themes support for the editors

Add clear button for each of three editors and clear all button also (use destroy() function https://ace.c9.io/#nav=api&api=editor)

Add mouseover text to minimize and maximize buttons

Add download as 3 separate files index.html , style.csss , app.js as .zip

Maybe try to add local environment where users can add pictures and refer to them in html files as if the images are in the same location as the source code.
