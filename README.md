![image](https://i.imgur.com/afbBsjS.png)

  - This is a code editor where you can write HTML, CSS, JS code and see the output there itself.
  - You can also download the source code.
  - Similar to codepen, jsfiddle

## To be implemented :-

  - Add different themes support for the three editors using drop down menu.
  - Add clear button for each of three editors and also "clear all" button. (use destroy() function https://ace.c9.io/#nav=api&api=editor)
  - Add mouseover text for minimize and maximize buttons.
  - Add download feature to download all the three files in one zip file.
  - Maybe try to add local environment where users can add pictures and refer to them in html files as if the images are in the same location as the source code.
